* Generalization of models means how well a model performs on new previously unseen data.
For models, the generalization error aka test error to be as small as possible.
* The generalization error is defined as the expected value of the error on a new input.
* Statistical Learning Theory provides a framework why why ML models perform well on test data when models have been
trained on the training data.
* Assumption that is made is i.i.d = > the distributions generating data are assumed to be identically distributed but
test and training data are independent. Identically distributed means drawn from same distribution.

$ \sum_{\forall i}{x_i^{2}} $
